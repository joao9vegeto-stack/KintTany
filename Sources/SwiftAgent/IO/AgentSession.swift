import Foundation
import Synchronization

/// The orchestrator between `AgentTransport` and `Conversation`.
///
/// `AgentSession` uses a two-task architecture:
/// - **Receive loop** (background Task): Always running, drains transport messages immediately
/// - **Turn processor** (main context): Executes turns sequentially from an internal queue
///
/// This separation ensures that `.approvalResponse` and `.cancel` messages
/// are processed promptly even while a turn is executing.
///
/// When a transport does **not** support background receive (e.g., `StdioTransport`
/// shares stdin with `CLIPermissionHandler`), the receive loop is paused during
/// turn execution via a `TurnGate` to prevent stdin contention.
///
/// ## Usage
///
/// ```swift
/// let session = Conversation(
///     languageModelSession: LanguageModelSession(
///         model: SystemLanguageModel.default,
///         tools: [ReadTool(), ExecuteCommandTool()]
///     ) {
///         Instructions("You are a coding assistant.")
///     }
/// ) {
///     GenerateText { (input: String) in Prompt(input) }
/// }
///
/// let transport = StdioTransport(prompt: "> ")
/// let session = AgentSession(transport: transport, approvalHandler: CLIPermissionHandler())
/// try await session.run(conversation)
/// ```
///
/// ## Turn Lifecycle
///
/// ```
/// receive(RunRequest)
///     → idempotency check (skip if turnID already completed)
///     → route by input type:
///         .text → enqueue to turn processor
///         .approvalResponse → resolve pending approval (immediate)
///         .cancel → match turnID to active token or record as pending cancel
/// ```
