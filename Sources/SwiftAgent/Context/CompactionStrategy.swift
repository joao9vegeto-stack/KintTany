/// A strategy for compacting conversation context when approaching limits.
///
/// Implement this protocol to define custom compaction behaviors.
/// The framework provides several built-in strategies:
///
/// - ``TruncationCompactionStrategy``: Removes oldest entries
/// - ``PriorityCompactionStrategy``: Removes entries based on priority scores
/// - ``HybridCompactionStrategy``: Combines multiple strategies
///
/// ## Example
///
/// ```swift
/// struct CustomStrategy: CompactionStrategy {
///     let name = "custom"
///     let description = "My custom compaction logic"
///
///     func compact(
///         transcript: Transcript,
///         targetTokens: Int,
///         context: CompactionContext
///     ) async throws -> CompactedTranscript {
///         // Custom compaction logic
///     }
/// }
/// ```

    ///
    /// - Parameters:
    ///   - transcript: The current transcript to compact.
    ///   - targetTokens: Target token count after compaction.
    ///   - context: Additional context for compaction decisions.
    /// - Returns: A compacted transcript with metadata.
