/// A lightweight description of a tool returned from a runtime search.

/// `Tool` protocol so that Gateway tools (e.g. `ToolSearchTool`) can render
/// results without importing every tool implementation.

// MARK: - ToolExecutor

/// An abstraction over the tool runtime that Gateway tools can depend on.
///
/// Gateway tools (tools that dispatch further tool calls) read the current
/// executor from `ToolExecutorContext.current` at call time. This avoids
/// passing the runtime by construction and keeps Gateway tools free of
/// lifetime coupling with the runtime.
///
/// Every `execute` call goes through the same middleware pipeline, which
/// means a Gateway tool's dispatched invocations automatically receive the
/// same permission checks, sandboxing, and observability as direct tool
/// calls from the LLM.
public protocol ToolExecutor: Sendable {
    /// Executes a registered tool by name.
    ///
    /// - Parameters:
    ///   - toolName: The registered tool name.
    ///   - argumentsJSON: A JSON-encoded argument payload. Decoding happens
    ///     inside the middleware chain's leaf, so any middleware (permission,
    ///     sandbox, plugin) runs before deserialization.
    /// - Returns: The tool's `String` output.
    /// - Throws: `ToolRuntimeError.unknownTool` if no tool with the given
    ///   name is registered, or any error raised by middleware/the tool.

    ///   - query: A free-form query string. Implementations may rank by
    ///     name, description, or more advanced heuristics.
    ///   - topN: The maximum number of matches to return.
    /// - Returns: Matches ordered from most to least relevant.

// MARK: - ToolExecutorContext

/// TaskLocal storage for the current `ToolExecutor`.
///
/// Gateway tools read `ToolExecutorContext.current` to dispatch further
/// tool calls through the runtime. The runtime sets this value before
/// invoking the middleware chain, so any code running inside a middleware
/// or a leaf tool can access it without construction-time injection.
///
/// ## Example
///
/// ```swift
/// struct MyGatewayTool: Tool {
///     func call(arguments: Args) async throws -> Output {
///         guard let executor = ToolExecutorContext.current else {
///             throw ToolRuntimeError.executorUnavailable
///         }
///         let result = try await executor.execute(
///             toolName: arguments.dispatch,
///             argumentsJSON: arguments.payload
///         )
///         return Output(result: result)
///     }
/// }
